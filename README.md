# Ilya — Aspiring Neural Network Developer 👋

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-learning-yellow)

Hi — I'm **Ilya**.  
I'm studying **Applied Informatics** and currently taking the **"Neural Network Developer"** course by **The Founder**. I came into IT because it fascinates me and I want to grow my skills and build real projects. Right now I don't have finished public projects — this profile will track my learning, experiments, and future contributions.
