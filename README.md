Hi â€” I'm **Ilya**.  
I'm studying **Applied Informatics** and currently taking the **"Neural Network Developer"** course by **The Founder**. I came into IT because it fascinates me and I want to grow my skills and build real projects. Right now I don't have finished public projects â€” this profile will track my learning, experiments, and future contributions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Finish **Neural Network Developer** course within **1 year**.
- Build and publish practical ML / neural network projects.

---

## ðŸ”­ Current Focus
- Neural networks & deep learning fundamentals  
- Practical model implementation and experimentation
